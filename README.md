<h3>PROCESS:</h3>
<p>The given excel file had data for classes of both second and third year <br>
But the given task had mentioned to display the time-table for only second-year students <br>
So I have accessed data only for 2nd year students <br>
By creating array of arrays(or list of lists), I was able to enter data for each branch on a given single day<br>
And I have inputted the current date and time of the system and depending on whether its before or after 6:00pm I have mentioned the classes accordingly
